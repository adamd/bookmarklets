# Handy Bookmarklets

Little snippets of JavaScript that I've used in my bookmark bar, now shared with you.

## Google Site Search

Redirect from the current page to a `site:` search of that page with any keyword you want. I've used this for 10+ years, going back to my time editing [ProgrammableWeb](https://www.programmableweb.com/), so it defaults to a search for "api."

## Markdown Link of Current Page

If you write a lot of Markdown, you want to grab a link quickly, without multiple copy-paste adventures. Put the title and URL of the current page into a link using Markdown syntax. Super handy for creating lists of resources.
